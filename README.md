Config File
---
Different with [v2ray-core](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core), VMecs's config
file currently would follow the key-value style for simplicity, shown below:
```
log.path=/var/log/vmecs.log

inbound.proto=vmess
inbound.addr=example.org
inbound.port=1080
i_option.uuid=56290e54-9b64-4ea7-b211-deadbeefcafe
i_option.method=aes-128-gcm

outbound.proto=freedom
outbound.addr=0.0.0.0
...
```

> Please note that this project is not finalized for releasing the initial version.
> All current documentation could be changed in the further releases of the VMecs code or binary.
